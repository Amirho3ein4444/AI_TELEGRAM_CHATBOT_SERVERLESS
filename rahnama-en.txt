What You’ll Build
Your chatbot will:
Use Appwrite Cloud to store data (like user info and chat history) and run the code that makes it work.

Use OpenRouter to generate smart replies (it’s free!).

Work on Telegram, so people can message it like a friend.

You’ll store your project’s code on GitHub (don’t worry, I’ll explain what that is), and you’ll use a file called main.js (which you already have) to power the chatbot.
Before You Start (Prerequisites)
You don’t need much to begin, just:
A computer with an internet connection.

A web browser (like Google Chrome, Firefox, or Safari).

A phone or computer with Telegram installed (you can download it from telegram.org if you don’t have it).

An email address to sign up for accounts.

That’s it! Let’s get started.
Step 1: Sign Up for Appwrite Cloud
Appwrite Cloud is a free service that acts like the “brain” of your chatbot. It stores data and runs your code.
Open Your Browser: Open a web browser on your computer.

Go to Appwrite: Type this into the address bar and press Enter: https://appwrite.io/.

Sign Up: Look at the top-right corner of the page. You’ll see a Sign Up button. Click it.

Choose How to Sign Up:
You can click Sign up with Google and use a Google account, or

Click Sign up with Email, then fill in your email and a password.

Finish Signing Up: Follow the steps on the screen (like entering your name). If you used an email, check your inbox for a verification link and click it.

Log In: Once your account is ready, go back to https://appwrite.io/, click Log In, and enter your email/password or Google account details.

You’re now in the Appwrite dashboard! This is where you’ll manage your chatbot.
Step 2: Create a Project in Appwrite Cloud
A “project” is like a workspace for your chatbot in Appwrite.
Find the Dashboard: After logging in, you’ll see a screen with a big Create Project button in the middle.

Click Create Project: Click that button.

Name Your Project: A small window will pop up. In the box that says “Project Name,” type something simple like MyChatbot. Then click the blue Create button at the bottom of the window.

Wait a Second: Appwrite will set up your project. When it’s done, you’ll see a new screen with your project name at the top.

You now have a project! This is where all your chatbot stuff will live.
Step 3: Set Up the Database in Appwrite
Your chatbot needs a place to store information, like who’s chatting with it and what they’ve said. In Appwrite, this place is called a database, and inside the database, you’ll create collections (think of them as folders). You need three collections: Users, Sessions, and Chats. I’ll walk you through making each one exactly how your code needs them.
3.1 Create the "Users" Collection
This collection will store info about people who use your chatbot.
Go to Database: On the left side of your Appwrite project screen, click the Database icon (it looks like a little filing cabinet).

Add a Collection: At the top of the Database page, click the Add Collection button (it’s orange).

Name It: In the “Name” box, type Users (capital “U”). Then click the blue Create button.

Add Attributes: Now you’re inside the “Users” collection. You need to tell Appwrite what kind of info to store here by adding “attributes” (like columns in a table). Click Add Attribute (orange button at the top).
Attribute 1: telegramId
Type: Click the dropdown and pick String (this is for text).

Key: Type telegramId (all lowercase).

Size: Type 255 (this means it can hold up to 255 characters).

Required: Check the box next to “Required” (this means every user must have this).

Click the blue Create button.

Attribute 2: username
Type: Pick String again.

Key: Type username (all lowercase).

Size: Type 255.

Required: Leave this unchecked (not every user will have a username).

Click Create.

Attribute 3: createdAt
Type: Pick DateTime (this is for dates and times).

Key: Type createdAt (lowercase “c”, then “A”, then “t”).

Required: Check the “Required” box.

Click Create.

Check Your Work: You should see three attributes listed: telegramId, username, and createdAt. If you made a mistake, click the trash can icon next to an attribute to delete it and try again.

3.2 Create the "Sessions" Collection
This collection keeps track of active chats.
Go Back: Click Collections at the top of the Database page (it’s like a breadcrumb trail).

Add Another Collection: Click Add Collection again.

Name It: Type Sessions (capital “S”) and click Create.

Add Attributes: Click Add Attribute inside the “Sessions” collection.
Attribute 1: userId
Type: Pick String.

Key: Type userId (lowercase “u”, then “I”, then “d”).

Size: Type 255.

Required: Check “Required”.

Click Create.

Attribute 2: active
Type: Pick Boolean (this is for true/false values).

Key: Type active (all lowercase).

Default Value: Type true (lowercase).

Required: Check “Required”.

Click Create.

Attribute 3: createdAt
Type: Pick DateTime.

Key: Type createdAt.

Required: Check “Required”.

Click Create.

Check: You should see userId, active, and createdAt.

3.3 Create the "Chats" Collection
This collection stores the messages between users and the chatbot.
Go Back: Click Collections at the top.

Add Collection: Click Add Collection.

Name It: Type Chats (capital “C”) and click Create.

Add Attributes: Click Add Attribute.
Attribute 1: sessionId
Type: Pick String.

Key: Type sessionId (lowercase “s”, then “I”, then “d”).

Size: Type 255.

Required: Check “Required”.

Click Create.

Attribute 2: userId
Type: Pick String.

Key: Type userId.

Size: Type 255.

Required: Check “Required”.

Click Create.

Attribute 3: role
Type: Pick String.

Key: Type role (all lowercase).

Size: Type 255.

Required: Check “Required”.

Click Create.

Attribute 4: content
Type: Pick String.

Key: Type content (all lowercase).

Size: Type 10000 (this lets it hold long messages).

Required: Check “Required”.

Click Create.

Attribute 5: createdAt
Type: Pick DateTime.

Key: Type createdAt.

Required: Check “Required”.

Click Create.

Check: You should see sessionId, userId, role, content, and createdAt.

3.4 Save Your Collection IDs
Each collection has a special ID (like a serial number) that your code needs later.
Go to Collections: In the Database section, you’ll see your three collections listed: Users, Sessions, and Chats.

Get the IDs:
Click on Users.

Look at the top of the page. You’ll see “Collection ID” followed by a long string (e.g., 67f64d80000eb41830cf). Copy this string and paste it somewhere safe (like a text file on your computer). Label it “Users Collection ID”.

Go back to Collections, click Sessions, and copy its Collection ID. Label it “Sessions Collection ID”.

Do the same for Chats and label it “Chats Collection ID”.

Keep Them Safe: You’ll need these IDs later, so don’t lose them!

Step 4: Set Up OpenRouter
OpenRouter is a free service that gives your chatbot the ability to “think” and reply with smart answers.
Go to OpenRouter: Open your browser and type https://openrouter.ai/ in the address bar, then press Enter.

Sign Up: Click Sign Up at the top-right corner.

Choose a Method: Sign up with your Google account or use an email and password (just like Appwrite).

Verify: If you used an email, check your inbox for a verification link and click it.

Log In: Go back to https://openrouter.ai/, click Log In, and enter your details.

Get an API Key:
On the left side, click Keys (it might look like a little key icon).

Click the Create Key button.

In the “Name” box, type something like ChatbotKey.

Click Generate.

You’ll see a long string starting with sk-or- (e.g., sk-or-abc123xyz). Copy this and paste it into your text file. Label it “OpenRouter API Key”.

Step 5: Create a Telegram Bot
Telegram is where people will talk to your chatbot. You’ll create a bot using a special Telegram account called BotFather.
Open Telegram: Use the Telegram app on your phone or go to https://web.telegram.org/ in your browser.

Sign In: Log in with your phone number if you haven’t already (Telegram will send you a code to verify).

Find BotFather: In the search bar at the top, type BotFather and press Enter. You’ll see an account with a blue checkmark. Click it to start a chat.

Start the Chat: Type /start and press Enter (or click the Start button if you’re on the app).

Make a New Bot:
Type /newbot and press Enter.

BotFather will ask for a name. Type something like MyCoolChatbot and press Enter.

Next, it’ll ask for a username. Type something ending with “Bot”, like MyCoolChatbotBot, and press Enter. (Usernames must be unique, so if it’s taken, try adding numbers, e.g., MyCoolChatbotBot123.)

Get the Token: BotFather will reply with a message saying “Done!” and give you a token. It looks like this: 123456:ABC-DEF1234ghIkl-zyx57W2v1u123ew11. Copy the whole thing and paste it into your text file. Label it “Telegram Bot Token”.

Test It: In Telegram, search for your bot’s username (e.g., @MyCoolChatbotBot) and click Start. It won’t reply yet, but this confirms it exists!

Step 6: Set Up GitHub
GitHub is a website where people store and share code. Think of it as a big online folder for your project. Don’t worry if this sounds confusing—I’ll guide you through it.
Go to GitHub: Open your browser and type https://github.com/ in the address bar, then press Enter.

Sign Up: Click Sign Up at the top-right corner.

Fill in Details:
Pick a username (e.g., YourName123).

Enter your email and a password.

Solve the little puzzle they give you to prove you’re not a robot.

Click Create account.

Verify: Check your email for a code from GitHub, enter it on the screen, and follow any extra steps (like picking a free plan).

Log In: Go back to https://github.com/, click Sign In, and use your new username and password.

Create a Repository:
At the top-right corner, click the + button and choose New repository.

In the “Repository name” box, type something like my-chatbot.

Under “Public or Private,” pick Public (this means anyone can see it).

Check the box that says Add a README file (this adds a basic info page).

Click the green Create repository button at the bottom.

Understand What You Did: You now have a “repository” (a fancy word for a project folder) on GitHub. This is where your chatbot’s code will live.

Step 7: Create a Serverless Function in Appwrite Cloud
A “serverless function” is the code that makes your chatbot work. It runs on Appwrite Cloud and connects everything together. Here’s how to set it up.
7.1 Start a New Function
Go to Functions: In your Appwrite project dashboard (the one named MyChatbot), look at the left sidebar. Click Functions (it looks like a little rocket or code symbol).

Create a Function: Click the orange Create Function button at the top.

Fill in Details:
Name: Type ChatbotFunction in the “Name” box.

Runtime: Click the dropdown next to “Runtime” and pick Node.js 18 (or the latest Node.js version available).

Click the blue Next button.

Connect to GitHub:
On the next screen, under “Deployment Source,” pick GitHub.

Click Connect GitHub. A pop-up will ask you to log in to GitHub. Use your GitHub username and password.

After logging in, GitHub will ask if Appwrite can access your repositories. Click Authorize Appwrite.

Back in Appwrite, under “Repository,” click the dropdown and pick your repository (e.g., my-chatbot).

Click the blue Create button.

7.2 Add Your Code
Your chatbot needs a file called main.js (which you already have) to work. Let’s add it to GitHub.
Go to Your Repository: In your browser, go to your GitHub repository. The address will be something like https://github.com/YourName123/my-chatbot. Replace YourName123 with your username.

Add a File:
Click the Add file button (near the top-right).

Choose Create new file from the dropdown.

Name the File: In the “Name your file” box at the top, type src/main.js. (The src/ part creates a folder called “src” and puts “main.js” inside it.)

Add the Code: You already have the main.js code. Paste it into the big text box on the screen.

Save It:
Scroll to the bottom.

In the “Commit new file” section, leave the default message (“Create src/main.js”).

Click the green Commit new file button.

Wait: Appwrite will notice this new file and start setting up your function. This might take a minute.

7.3 Set Environment Variables
Your function needs some settings (called “environment variables”) to connect to Appwrite, OpenRouter, and Telegram.
Go to Your Function: In Appwrite, click Functions on the left, then click your function (ChatbotFunction).

Open Settings: Click the Settings tab at the top.

Find Variables: Scroll down to the “Variables” section.

Add These Variables: For each one, click Add Variable, fill in the “Key” and “Value,” and click Save. Here’s the list:
Key: APPWRITE_ENDPOINT | Value: https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1 (type this exactly).

Key: APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID | Value: Go to your project’s main dashboard (click Home on the left). At the top, copy the “Project ID” (e.g., 67f6ead918e72f1f30f4) and paste it here.

Key: APPWRITE_API_KEY | Value:
Go to Settings on the left sidebar (the gear icon).

Click API Keys > Add API Key.

Name it ChatbotKey.

Under “Scopes,” check databases.read, databases.write, and functions.read.

Click Generate, then copy the key (e.g., abc123xyz...) and paste it here.

Key: OPENROUTER_API_KEY | Value: Paste your OpenRouter API Key from your text file.

Key: TELEGRAM_TOKEN | Value: Paste your Telegram Bot Token from your text file.

Key: USERS_COLLECTION_ID | Value: Paste the Users Collection ID from your text file.

Key: SESSIONS_COLLECTION_ID | Value: Paste the Sessions Collection ID from your text file.

Key: CHATS_COLLECTION_ID | Value: Paste the Chats Collection ID from your text file.

Save Everything: Click the Update button at the bottom of the Settings page.

Step 8: Connect Telegram to Your Function
Telegram needs to know where your chatbot lives so it can send messages to it. This is called setting a “webhook.”
Get Your Function URL: In Appwrite, go to Functions, click ChatbotFunction, and click the Settings tab. Scroll down to “Function Domain” and copy the URL (e.g., https://67f6ead918e72f1f30f4.appwrite.global).

Set the Webhook:
Open a new browser tab.

In the address bar, paste this exact URL, but replace the parts in < > with your info:

https://api.telegram.org/bot<YourBotToken>/setWebhook?url=<YourFunctionURL>

Replace <YourBotToken> with your Telegram Bot Token (e.g., 123456:ABC-DEF1234ghIkl-zyx57W2v1u123ew11).

Replace <YourFunctionURL> with your Function Domain (e.g., https://67f6ead918e72f1f30f4.appwrite.global).

Example: https://api.telegram.org/bot123456:ABC-DEF1234ghIkl-zyx57W2v1u123ew11/setWebhook?url=https://67f6ead918e72f1f30f4.appwrite.global

Press Enter.

Check the Result: Your browser should show something like:

{"ok":true,"result":true,"description":"Webhook was set"}

If you see an error, double-check your token and URL.

Step 9: Test Your Chatbot
Open Telegram: Go back to Telegram and find your bot (e.g., @MyCoolChatbotBot).

Send a Message: Type /start or just say “Hi” and press Enter.

Wait: Your bot should reply! If it doesn’t:
Go to Appwrite > Functions > ChatbotFunction > Executions tab.

Look for errors (like “Missing variable”) and fix your environment variables if needed.

Step 10: Share Your Project on GitHub
Since this is open-source, let’s make your GitHub repository look nice and shareable.
Make It Public:
Go to your GitHub repository (e.g., https://github.com/YourName123/my-chatbot).

Click Settings at the top.

Scroll to the bottom to “Danger Zone.”

Click Make public and confirm.

Add a License:
Click Add file > Create new file.

Name it LICENSE (all caps).

Paste this text:

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software...

(Get the full text from https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT. Replace 2023 with the current year and YourName with your name.)

Click Commit new file.

Update README:
Click README.md in your repository.

Click the pencil icon to edit.

Replace its contents with:
